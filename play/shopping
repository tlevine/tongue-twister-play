*A group returns home, entering through the front door, with lots of shopping bags.*


*A Russian walks down the stars, excited to see the group.*

**The Russian** Tell me about your purchases!

**Someone from the group** What purchases?

**The Russian** About purchases, purchases, your little purchases!
(Russian: Раскажи мне про покупки!
Про какие про покупки?
Про покупки, про покупки, про покупочки твои!)

**Person A from the group** I went to the store and saw a huge potato, went home and was happy.
(Kikuyu: Dathie donyo daria duma dugu dakena dainoka!)
